## Instructions

- Enter a video URL. Tons of websites are supported
- Go through the video and hit the "Save Time" button to save the current video timestamp to the right side of the screen.

## Notes

- To preview if the current time would be good to save, press and hold the "Peep the Horror" button. Once you release it, the video will jump back to where it was when you started pressing it.
